                Logging in or signing up to an application or website is a
                straightforward process designed to ensure secure access and
                user personalization. The "Log In" feature typically requires
                users to input their registered email address or username along
                with their password. In contrast, the "Sign Up" process involves
                creating a new account by providing details such as full name,
                email, and password, and sometimes agreeing to the platformâ€™s
                terms and conditions.

                In short, the AI chatbot is a software solution that serves as a
                digital assistant to:
                <br />
                - Provides information in the form of texts, photos, buttons for
                additional information and quick links, audio; it is a fast and
                easy self-service tool
                <br />
                - Is a two-way communication tool: the conversational AI
                simulates the conversation with a human, instantly identifying
                the meaning of the inquiry and providing a response from the
                built database.
                <br />
                - Collects feedback and inquiries: another important element is
                the forms that allow customers to contact the business quickly
                and easily, make an inquiry, or other.
